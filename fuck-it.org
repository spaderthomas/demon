* THE PLAN
** THE BEFORE
1. Keep Anna Twill close to us. Plant the idea in her head that we heard from
   our meeting with <dude who traded info> that there are infected people and
   demons in Culvex Tower, and we have decided to go all the way in and use the
   fact that we're infected to try and rescue and save them. There's nothing
   these angels want more than to keep the quarantine, so as long as we can make
   it convincing enough, it should draw them like flies to honey.
2. Make sure everyone who will be on the plane will have valid plane tickets on
   the same plane
3. Make sure we have plenty of Aether for opening and closing boltholes
4. Acquire weapons for plane hijacking. Presumably, we'll do this by upgrading
   Mike's bolthole.
5. Make sure we understand the lay of the land -- is it possible to get a plane
   to hit Culvex Tower? Are there any buildings we have to miss?
6. Pump up all appropriate stats, get any necessary embeds.

** THE DURING
PLANE PARTY (PP): Brian, Thomas (Deep Pockets)
CULVEX TOWER PARTY (CTP): Mike, Anna Twill (possessed?)

1. CTP goes to Culvex Tower and begins poking around in the infrastructure.
2. PP boards their flight
3. CTP sends confirmation to PP when AOTUH or Seraphim Samite show up
4. Once flight reaches critical distance from the city or confirmation is
   received, PP pulls weapons drop {Deep Pockets, Bolthole} and hijacks the
   plane
   * Editor's note: It seems like it'll be fairly easy to hijack the
     plane. However, the timing will be too hard. If the angels don't show up in
     a fairly short time window, we're gonna have to make a judgment call on
     whether to hijack the plane, or we'll be too far to turn it around and
     crash it.
5. PP sends confirmation to CTP of successful hijacking, and CTP pulls the fire
   alarm in Culvex Tower.
6. PP routes all plane passengers into bolthole
   * Is bolthole big enough for this?
7. CTP fends off angels until evacuation signal sent from PP
8. PP sends evacuation signal, CTP quickly runs as far and as fast as they can
   away from Culvex Tower
9. PP steers plane on crash course, at last second boltholes out

* CAVEATS
1. Kill as few innocents as possible
2. How do we make sure Cameron doesn't understand what we're doing for as long
   as possible?
